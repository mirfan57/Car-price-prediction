## Overview
Both consumers and sellers potentially benefit from being able to forecast the market value of used vehicles. Many people have an interest in the used vehicle market at some time in their lives when they need to sell or purchase a vehicle. It's a risky move to pay too much or sell something for less than it's worth through this whole process.

In this project, we'll use a variety of factors, including Car name, kms Driven, Fuel Type, Owner, Transmission, Mileage, Max Power, Speed, etc., to estimate the price of used cars. This information was downloaded from Kaggle.

## A brief description about the project
Car Price Prediction is a Supervised Machine learning problem statement.
Using Regression Algorithm, we try to predict the selling price of the used cars based on certain features provided by the user.

## Libraries Used

**Data Pre-Processing**

- **Numpy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**

**Model Building**

- **Sklearn**, **statsmodels**

**Hyperparameter Tuning**

- **RandomizedSearchCV**, **GridSearchCV**

## Introduction

**Car Price Prediction**

**Dataset taken from:** [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv)

***Data Set Information:***

- The dataset contains 8128 instances of various used cars listed on different websites.

- The dataset includes 13 attributes including an output attribute (numerical), i.e., a total of 12 feature (independent) columns and 1 target (dependent) column.

**Attribute Information:**

The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

**1. name**

**2. year**

**3. selling_price**

**4. km_driven**

**5. fuel**

**6. seller_type**

**7. transmission**

**8. Owner**

**9. Mileage**

**10. Engine**

**11. Max_power**

**12. Torque**

**13. Seats**

### Step-by-step implementation of this project

1. Loading Data
2. Data Pre-Processing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection
6. Model Building
8. Hyperparameter Tuning
9. Flask framework

### Fine Tuning

HyperParameter Tuning performed using **RandomizedSearchCV** for the model which performed best for Regression task.

### WebApp
* The web framework employed for this model deployment is Flask.

* If you are searching for Code, EDA, ML algorithms used and metrics obtained. Please look for "Car Price prediction.ipynb" file.
